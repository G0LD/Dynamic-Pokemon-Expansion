Thought this would be the fastest way to talk to you. We have problems with 2.7.2 already, including bright ride still freezing in dark cave if you dont have the badge for it, and super nerd's name is gibberish. However, the biggest issue is encounters. I fixed all the day encounters and gave you the patch for it, but 2.7.2 does not have this. Night encounters are correct, at their proper levels and spawns. For example, ilex forest has level 12-16 at night, but during the day it has 6-14. This is pretty big since some pokemon will not spawn, which was one of the reasons I had to go through the encounters in the first place. I can attempt to send you the correct spawns in some way, either through screenshots or maybe just give you the file with the correct ones. I apologize for the inconvenience this causes.
